<title>Hello and welcome to my build I hope you enjoy it. Please allow addons to update before using kodi. Kodi 17.6 has been released please update through playstore again.There is some bad news for the good addons what we use there are going through some changes like closing down. I will let you know more as it comes in. OMG check out Elysium it's back and better in all addons. Also have a look around in all addons for more addons and around the build. After using kodi please exit and turn off your box!. Please give me feedback on the build and if you want a update of the build. PM me on Facebook or email me on jwilliamson2006@hotmail.co.uk thanks juggy</title>
