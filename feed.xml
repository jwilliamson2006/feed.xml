<title>Hello and welcome to my build I hope you enjoy it updates of my build are now available for 2018. Please allow addons to update before using kodi. New add-ons have now been added like oculus. For acestream links on sports download the app from playstore and just open it then go in kodi and find a acestream link. Also have a look around in all addons for more addons and around the build. After using kodi please exit and turn off your box!. We are all using terrarium TV app aswell if you need the app Google it and download it and install it and if it needs a update, update and install it.
